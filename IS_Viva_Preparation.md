# A1 — Bitwise Operations (AND, OR, XOR)

## What is this Practical?
Demonstrates bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations on ASCII values of `"Hello World"` using value `127`.

---

## Code Explanation
- `ord(ch)` converts character to ASCII integer.
- `& 127` → keeps lower 7 bits.
- `| 127` → sets lower 7 bits to 1.
- `^ 127` → flips lower 7 bits.

Example:
- `'H' = 72 = 01001000`
- `72 ^ 127 = 55`

---

## Important Theory
- ASCII maps characters to integers.
- `127 = 01111111`
- XOR is reversible:

```math
A \oplus K \oplus K = A
```

- AND is not reversible because information is lost.

---

## Viva Questions & Answers

### Q: What does `ord()` do?
**A:** Converts character into ASCII/Unicode integer value.

### Q: Why is 127 used?
**A:** `127 = 01111111` in binary. It affects only lower 7 bits.

### Q: Why is XOR important in cryptography?
**A:** XOR is reversible, fast, and widely used in encryption algorithms.

### Q: Is XOR reversible?
**A:** Yes. `A ^ K ^ K = A`.

### Q: What is One-Time Pad?
**A:** OTP uses XOR with a truly random key of same length.

### Q: Difference between AND and XOR?
**A:** AND loses information; XOR preserves information and is reversible.

## Viva Questions & Answers

### Q: Why is RSA asymmetric?
**A:** Uses separate public and private keys.

### Q: Why must `p` and `q` be prime?
**A:** RSA mathematics depends on primes.

```math
(e \times d) \bmod \phi = 1
```
